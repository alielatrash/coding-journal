    <p>So today I finished the HTML foundations piece. I'm now getting into the CSS one. It's been pretty fun so far, but it got a bit boring at the end. I feel like it's been slightly easy and straightforward. I'm also not a total noob to be honest. HTML and CSS are languages (if I'm allowed to call them languages) that I've worked with before. Albeit at an elementary level, but still.. I'm not a total noob. As you can see so far, everything is super plain. But, as we go, let's hope I can clean this up well.</p>
    <p>Now, I'm going to start the CSS course. Let's see how it goes!</p>
    <p>But before I go, let me push this out and also get a shareable link for the blog.</p>
